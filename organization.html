## About Bank Pool Amsterdam

Bank Pool Amsterdam was founded with a simple goal: to create a dedicated space for players to enjoy and compete in Bank Pool, one of cue sports' most unique and challenging disciplines.

Born from a passion for this niche format, the tournament was established to offer a platform where enthusiasts — both newcomers and seasoned players — can meet, play, and grow together around a shared love for bank shots.

While Bank Pool remains relatively uncommon in Europe, we believe it deserves a stronger presence. Through organized, fair, and accessible tournaments, our mission is to promote the growth of Bank Pool, and celebrate the high level of skill and precision it demands, raise awareness of its rich tactical depth, and foster a sense of community among its players.

Whether you're just discovering the game or have been banking for years, Bank Pool Amsterdam warmly welcomes you.
