# ⏱️ Operational Buffer Time

To account for real-world conditions, the estimated match durations should be adjusted to include operational overhead. A **25–30% buffer** is recommended to cover:

- Player delays or absences
- Referee calls or disputes
- Breaks between rounds (meals, restrooms)
- Table maintenance or cleaning
- Re-racks or slow play
- Matches exceeding 60-minute average

These buffers ensure a realistic and efficient tournament schedule with reduced risk of overruns or delays.
