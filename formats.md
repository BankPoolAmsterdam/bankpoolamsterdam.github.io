## ⏱️ Including Operational Buffer Time

To account for real-world conditions, the estimated match durations should be adjusted to include operational overhead. A **25–30% buffer** is recommended to cover:

- Player delays or absences
- Referee calls or disputes
- Breaks between rounds (meals, restrooms)
- Table maintenance or cleaning
- Matches exceeding 40-minute average
- Re-racks due to fouls or illegal breaks

These buffers ensure a realistic and efficient tournament schedule with reduced risk of overruns or delays.
